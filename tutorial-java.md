title: Tutorial (Java) WIP
---

This tutorial describes how to create a simple agent for the competition in Java. This tutorial uses screenshots from the Java IDE [Eclipse 4.6.3 for Linux](http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/packages/eclipse-ide-java-ee-developers/neon3) but should work for any IDE. 

**Step 1: Download the engine from Github** 

Go to [the competition's gitbub resository](https://github.com/Atkrye/IEEE-CIG-Text-Adventurer-Competition) and either checkout everything using your favourite Git client or simply download everything as a .zip file.

**Step 2: Create a new Java 8 Project**

Do this with your IDE of preference but to ensure compatability make sure that you are using Java 1.8 and above.
