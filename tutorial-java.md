title: Tutorial (Java)
---

This tutorial describes how to create a simple agent for the competition in Java. 

**Step 1: Download the engine from Github** 

Go to [the competition's gitbub resository](https://github.com/Atkrye/IEEE-CIG-Text-Adventurer-Competition) and either checkout everything using your favourite Git client or simply download everything as a .zip file.

**Step 2: Create a new Java 8 Project**

The competition will be scored according to two independent criteria:

* **C1**: Score on an unseen game instance (objective, built-in to the instance)
* **C2**: Freedom from a priori bias (subjective decision by the judges)

C1 is the dominant criterion, with C2 deciding in the event of a tie. C2 is intended to motivate participants to favour agents that have no (or less) prior knowledge of the problem domain built in.

**Competition Entry Deadline: August 1st 2017 23:59 UTC-12**
