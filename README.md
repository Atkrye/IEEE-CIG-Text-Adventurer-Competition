<b><h6>IEEE-CIG-Text-Adventurer-Competition</h6></b>

This is the repository for the 2016 IEEE CIG Text Adventurer Competition. This is a competition where entrants submit agents to compete at completing games for the classic text adventuring engine, the Z-Machine.

Within this repository there is an example Java project built in Eclipse, contained within the <i>Example Project</i> folder, which contains an agent that explores the game through random movements.

A second example project exists within the <i>Python - Example Project</i> which demonstrates using the frameworks build-in IOAgent.java class that allows exterior packages to interact with the Z-Machine.

For more information on using these resources and getting started, please visit TODO.
