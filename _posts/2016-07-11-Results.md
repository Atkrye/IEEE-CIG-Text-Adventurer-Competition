title: 2016 Competition Results and Future Plans
---

We are pleased to announce the winner of our 2016 competition was the BYU TextPlayer by David Wingate, Daniel Ricks, Nancy Fulda and Ben Murdoch from the [Perception Control and Cognition lab](http://pcc.cs.byu.edu/index.html) at Brigham Young University.

The winning team achieved an impressive score of 18 (out of a maximum 100) on our test environment game, and are considering releasing their agent as open source after publishing their methodology.

The competition team are now considering how best to proceed in 2017 and are keen to hear:

- if there is enthusiasm from the community for the competition to run again? 
- and about any issues that prevented teams from submitting this year?
