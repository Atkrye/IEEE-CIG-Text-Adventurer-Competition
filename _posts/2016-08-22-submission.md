title: Submission Instructions
---

With just over a week left until the competition deadline, its great to see activity picking up on the [Google Group](https://groups.google.com/d/forum/text-adventure-ai-competition) and [Github repo](https://github.com/Atkrye/IEEE-CIG-Text-Adventurer-Competition)!

For the submission of agents, please email:

- all files necessary to run your agent;
- instructions for executing your agent;
- a brief (1 page max) document explaining the method you have used.

To: TextAdventureAIComp@gmail.com 

The absolute final deadline for the submission of agents is **August 31st 2016 23:59 UTC-12**. After this date no revisions of agents will be accepted. So it is worthwhile sending us your code earlier, and talking with the team, to ensure that we can run your code as you intend to provide it.

We're excited to see what you have all been working on, and look forward to hopefully meeting some of you at [the conference](http://cig16.image.ece.ntua.gr)!
