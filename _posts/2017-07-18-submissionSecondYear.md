title: 2017 Submission Instructions
---

We're in to the final two weeks until the competition deadline: **August 1st 2017 23:59 UTC-12.**

For the submission of agents, please email:

- all files necessary to run your agent;
- instructions for executing your agent;
- a brief (1 page max) document explaining the method you have used.

To: TextAdventureAIComp@gmail.com

The absolute final deadline for the submission of agents is **August 1st 2017 23:59 UTC-12.** After this date no revisions of agents will be accepted. So it is worthwhile sending us your code earlier, and talking with the team, to ensure that we can run your code as you intend to provide it.

Weâ€™re excited to see what you have all been working on!
