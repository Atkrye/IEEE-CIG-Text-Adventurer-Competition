title: Potential Prizes for Student Participants
---

We're excited to note, that Professor Simon Lucas as has [just announced]( https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/cigames/-08uPgzKWIU) that there is potentially prize money available to student participants attending the [2016 IEEE Conference on Computational Intelligence and Games](http://cig16.image.ece.ntua.gr).

We must note there are strict conditions on the availability of prize money, and we cannot guarantee at this time its availability. We will keep the blog posted with any news as soon as we can after the submission deadline **August 31st 2016 23:59 UTC-12**
