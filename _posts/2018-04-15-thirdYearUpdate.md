title: 2018 Competition - Update
---

Firstly, the competition may disappear from the CIG 2018 website in the coming days. This is because the CIG organisers expect a short video to be produced for each competition by April 15th, but due to our own organisers travelling and intending to make some modifications to the code base, this may not happen for another week or two. We have been informed by CIG that upon producing a video, the competition will be listed again - so this does not mean the competition is cancelled.

We are also planning to add some new features to the code base to help both the development of entrants and the running of the competition: 
* The ability to run a given agent on a specified folder of games for a given number of steps.
* In built detection and reporting of an agent's score on a given game.
We'll let you know when these new features are available. They shouldn't cause any issues with your existing agents.
